# Nomad's Backpack ðŸŽ’

[Backpack](https://backpack.qm64.tech) ðŸŽ’ is a packaging system for
[Hashicorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io) that allows to:

* Helps you define and install complex jobs configuration
* Helps building reproducible jobs across multiple Nomad clusters
* Simplifies updates to new version of jobs
* Allows you to publish and share packages of applications

Please, keep in mind that this is designed for Nomad, and it might result as
very different than Helm, as Kubernetes is way more than a scheduler.

the differences between k8s and nomad
